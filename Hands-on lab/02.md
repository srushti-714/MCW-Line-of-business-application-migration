## Overview

Before the lab, you will have pre-deployed an on-premises infrastructure hosted in Hyper-V.  This infrastructure is hosting a multi-tier application called 'SmartHotel', using Hyper-V VMs for each of the application tiers.

During the lab, you will migrate this entire application stack to Azure. This will include assessing the on-premises application using Azure Migrate; assessing the database migration using Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA); migrating the database using the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS); and migrating the web and application tiers using Azure Migrate: Server Migration. This last step includes migration of both Windows and Linux VMs.
